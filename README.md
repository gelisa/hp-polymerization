To generate pickles with native lists, place files from 
the libraries/ folder into one of the following folders:

HP_designing_test # corresponds to "small" or "s" libraries
HP_designing_medm # corresponds to "medium" or "m" libraries
HP_designing_long # corresponds to "long" or "l" libraries

Then run appHPlibraryReader.py and choose the category of 
libaries you wish to process. The script will go through the 
libraries in the corresponding folder and convert them into 
pickles in the current directory.

Ready-to-use pickles up until the length 18 are available 
at the pickles/ folder.
